        <h2 class="text-danger">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
        <h5>Defination:</h5>
        <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is a cross-platform and language-independent interface which
            represents the HTML document as nodes and objects.<br>
        <ul>
            It defines:
            <li>The HTML elements as objects</li>
            <li>The properties of all HTML elements</li>
            <li>The methods to access all HTML elements</li>
            <li>The events for all HTML elements</li>
        </ul>
        In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose of DOM:</h5>
        <p>The purpose of the Document Object Model (DOM) is to provide a structured representation of a web page that
            can be accessed and manipulated by scripting languages such as JavaScript. By using DOM, developers can
            create dynamic and interactive web applications that can be accessed by a wide range of devices and
            technologies.</p>

        <h2 class="text-danger">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to select HTML elements using DOM. <br>
            Such as select an element by its ID and select elements by their tag name.
        </p>
        <h5>The DOM Methods:</h5>
        <p>There are many methods provided by the DOM. Some of them are -</p>
        <p>getElementById()</p>
        <p>getElementsByClassName()</p>
        <p>getElementsByTagName()</p>
        <p>addEventListener()</p>
        <p>createElement()</p>

        <h2 class="text-danger">3. What is event bubble?</h2>
        <p>Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event,
            and that event bubbles up or transmitted or propagated to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree
            until it gets to the root element.</p>


        <h2 class="text-danger">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
        <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. I'll use it to call
            another function when a certain task is completed or an event occurs.</p>
